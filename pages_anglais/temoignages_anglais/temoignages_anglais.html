        <p class="intro">This page offers two personal stories from former students who followed the computer science curriculum in various IUTs in France. We let you discover how they felt about the training!</p>

          <div class="temoignage1">
            <h3 class="titredamien">Testimony of Damien Lefebvre (IUT de Villetaneuse)</h3>
            <img class="damien" src="damien.png" alt="damien">
            <p class="temoignagedamien">

                With his Baccalauréat acquired, Damien Lefebvre spent a few months in college before reorienting himself in search of a more supervised education. His university experience having revealed him a pronounced taste for computer science, he decided to apply to the IUT of Villetaneuse in order to prepare a DUT in Computer Science with a Software Engineering option in 2002.

                The supervision offered by passionate professors and the acquisition of rigorous work methods encouraged him to complete his training via the Professional Licence in Computer Systems and Software, option Software Engineering, offered by the same IUT.

            <p class="citation">
                "The knowledge and skills developed through three years of studying algorithms, databases, but also the accounting aspects of the business world, were the key that enabled me to be recruited by a major French IT services company, after a four-month internship at the end of the year.

                For a year and a half now, the young Analyst Programmer has been putting his skills at the service of major clients, including renowned banking institutions, and in the future wishes to focus on "Consulting". "

        <div class="temoignage2">
            <h3 class="titrevirgile">Testimony of Virgile Dassonneville (IUT of Lens)</h3>
            <img class="virgile" src="ppdefaut.jpg" alt="virgile">
            <p class="temoignagevirgile">"The Computer Science DUT was, for me, a very enriching experience. I learned a lot of things, whether in the field of computer science (programming, networks) but also in more general subjects (economics, project management, communication...). The technologies taught are adapted to what the big IT companies use. The presence of tutored projects helps to put into practice the theoretical teachings. "</p>
